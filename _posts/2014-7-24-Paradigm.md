### Some warm regards from my time as a design intern abroad.

[Paradigm](http://www.paradigm.co.jp/) is a small communications agency based in Osaki district that specializes in branding and publishing. Formed in 1992, they have historical ties with international business community in Japan, currently publishing the [EURObiz Japan](https://eurobiz.jp/) magazine.

A big draw for me to intern at here was their range of projects – bilingual publications and interactive work like websites and apps, for both Japanese and non-Japanese clients. I really wanted to see what it’s like for a company like this.

I was able to contribute to on-going projects overseen by the production team, both internal and external. Better yet, I got to interact with a talented group of people from different cultural backgrounds – Irish, Australian, French, New Zealand, Japanese, and American. Along with me, a Chinese American, it made for an incredibly diverse workplace.

My time here has shown me the value of seeking out a diverse team. As the world becomes more and more globalized, having a diverse team able to work with clients from all kinds of backgrounds, and deliver bilingual products that appeal to multiple audiences, is a big advantage.
